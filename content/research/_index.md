My research focuses on computational approaches to understanding personality pathology, particularly Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I use advanced statistical methods and multimodal data analysis to investigate the developmental trajectories and neural mechanisms underlying BPD symptoms.

## Current Research Areas

**Computational Psychiatry & BPD**  
Developing computational models to understand the cognitive and emotional processes in borderline personality disorder, with a focus on interpersonal dysfunction and emotion dysregulation.

**Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience**  
Investigating how personality pathology emerges across development using longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral data.

**Psychometrics & Quantitative Methods**  
Advancing measurement approaches for personality pathology and developing novel statistical methods for analyzing complex psychological data.

**Multimodal Data Analysis**  
Integrating neuroimaging, behavioral, and ecological momentary assessment data to provide comprehensive models of personality functioning.
