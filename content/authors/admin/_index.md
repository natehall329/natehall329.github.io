Hey! I'm Nate, a graduate candidate in psychology and neuroscience at UNC-Chapel Hill. In the new digital age of web-based communication, collaboration, and promotion I figured it'd be a good idea to finally spin-up a website where I can highlight my work. Unfortunately, I'm in the middle of doing the work so this website will slowly have to build as I have time. So, sorry if you're seeing this then that means you are mostly looking at a template website! I'm only an email away if you need to reach me, and i promise ill have more material for you to "creep" on soon ;)
