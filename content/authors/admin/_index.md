I'm a graduate candidate in psychology and neuroscience at UNC-Chapel Hill who uses methods from computational psychiatry to understand (borderline) personality pathology. My research focuses on leveraging modern statistical and computational tools to elucidate the algorithmic and neurobiological underpinnings of personality pathology, with particular emphasis on the clustering of symptoms often described as borderline personality pathology‚Äîincluding affective instability, impulsivity, suicidality, and identity diffusion.

My path to computational psychiatry represents a deliberate evolution in my scientific approach. I trained for 5 years as a clinical psychology trainee, gaining invaluable hands-on experience with personality pathology in clinical settings. However, at the end of my pre-internship clinical training, I made the pivotal decision to pursue my passion for computational psychiatry research. This transition was motivated by my growing conviction that understanding the mechanisms underlying personality pathology requires more than clinical observation‚Äîit demands rigorous computational and quantitative approaches.

Rather than viewing borderline personality symptoms as discrete categories, I conceptualize them as clustered around empirically validated dimensions of human personality. This dimensional perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of how individual differences in core personality processes‚Äîsuch as emotional reactivity, impulse regulation, and social cognition‚Äîcontribute to the heterogeneous presentation of personality pathology. My approach recognizes that these symptoms exist on continua and that their co-occurrence reflects underlying shared mechanisms rather than arbitrary diagnostic boundaries.

A central challenge motivating my research is that much of our understanding of the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms contributing to individual differences (including psychopathology) rests on decades of research conducted within paradigms that have not prioritized the formalization of their proposed mechanisms. While this tradition has yielded important descriptive knowledge, it has left substantial gaps in our mechanistic understanding of how personality pathology emerges and persists.

To address these limitations, I utilize an integrative methodological approach that bridges three complementary domains. From experimental and cognitive psychology, I employ inhibitory control and socioemotional learning tasks that allow for precise measurement of cognitive processes. From computational neuroscience, I apply learning and decision-making models broadly, coupled with concurrent multimodal data collection that captures both behavioral and neural dynamics. From personality and psychopathology research, I leverage latent variable and longitudinal modeling approaches that can disentangle trait-like individual differences from state-dependent fluctuations and developmental changes.

This multifaceted approach enables me to move beyond purely descriptive accounts toward mechanistic models that can generate testable predictions about when, how, and why personality pathology manifests across different contexts and developmental periods. By formalizing the computational principles underlying personality processes, my research aims to bridge the gap between clinical phenomena and their underlying psychological and biological mechanisms.
