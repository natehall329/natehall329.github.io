I'm a graduate candidate in psychology and neuroscience at UNC-Chapel Hill who uses methods from computational psychiatry to understand (borderline) personality pathology. My research focuses on leveraging modern statistical and computational tools to elucidate the algorithmic and neurobiological underpinnings of personality pathology, with particular emphasis on the clustering of symptoms often described as borderline personality pathology—including affective instability, impulsivity, suicidality, and identity diffusion.

My path to computational psychiatry represents a bit of an accidental evolution in my scientific approach to studying personality pathology. I trained for 5 years as a clinical psychology trainee, gaining invaluable hands-on experience treating a range of personality and clinical disorders in a community outpatient setting. However, at the end of my pre-internship clinical training, I made the difficult decision to pursue my passion for computational psychiatry research. This transition was motivated by my growing conviction that understanding the mechanisms underlying personality pathology requires more than clinical observation—it demands rigorous computational and quantitative approaches. However,  my clinical training provided valuable insights into the interpersonal dynamics that often accompany personality pathology as well as how challenging the task of behavior and mental truly change is, even under excellent circumstances. 

Rather than viewing borderline personality symptoms as discrete/disease categories, I conceptualize them as clustered around empirically validated dimensions of human personality. This dimensional perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of how individual differences in core personality processes—such as emotional reactivity, impulse regulation, and social cognition—contribute to the heterogeneous population of people that have been diagnosed with a personality disorder. My approach to studying personality pathology recognizes that these symptoms exist on continua and that their co-occurrence likely reflects shared mechanisms (of some sort) rather than arbitrary diagnostic boundaries.

A central challenge motivating my research is that much of our understanding of the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms contributing to individual differences (including psychopathology) rests on decades of research conducted within paradigms that have not prioritized the formalization of their proposed mechanisms. While this tradition has yielded important descriptive knowledge, it has left substantial gaps in our mechanistic understanding of how personality pathology emerges and persists.

To address these limitations, I utilize an integrative methodological approach that bridges three complementary domains. From experimental and cognitive psychology, I employ inhibitory control and socioemotional learning tasks that elicit these cognitive processes. From computational neuroscience, I apply learning and decision-making models to formalize generative models of behavior on these cognitive tasks, often coupled with concurrent multimodal data collection that can capture concurrent behavioral and neural dynamics. From personality and psychopathology research, I leverage latent variable and longitudinal modeling approaches that can disentangle trait-like individual differences from within-person fluctuations and developmental changes.

This multifaceted approach enables my research program to move beyond purely descriptive accounts toward mechanistic models that can generate testable predictions about when, how, and why personality pathology manifests across different contexts and developmental periods. By formalizing the computational principles underlying core personality processes, my research aims to bridge the gap between clinical phenomena and their underlying psychological and biological mechanisms.

This is a question I get asked occasionally, so I thought I'd address it here. When I started my graduate training I was deeply invested in learning the tools that clinical psychologists used in psychotherapy to treat psychotherapy. Most of what I learned clinically comes from my time at PSU where I completed the coursework and clinical practicum requirements that every clinical trainee completes prior to internship. I learned invaluable lessons during my clinical training: I completed training courses in structured clinical assessment and diagnosis, motivational interviewing, CBT, and neuropsychological assessment. Outside of my formal clinical training, I was receiving assessment and diagnostic training from my research mentor, Dr. Michael Hallquist, to perform detailed clinical assessments for ongoing research studies in the lab and completed over 100 diagnostic interviews in this context. I was even lucky enough to complete two years of training in Transference Focused Psychotherapy for the treatment of patients with clinically significant personality pathology: a rare opportunity for instruction in a highly structured psychodynamic psychotherapy that many clinicians never receive.

This a rare opportunity to learn structured psychodynamic psychotherapy that is often left out of the training curriculum for many clinical psychology trainees.

By the time our lab moved to UNC Chapel Hill, my time was split between

While I completed substantial clinical training during my graduate program, including coursework in assessment, psychotherapy, and psychopathology, I ultimately decided not to pursue clinical internship or licensure as a clinical psychologist.

My decision was driven by my passion for research and discovery rather than direct clinical practice. I found myself most energized by questions about the underlying mechanisms of personality pathology, the development of new measurement approaches, and the application of computational methods to understand psychological phenomena.

The clinical training I received has been invaluable to my research - it provides me with a deep understanding of the lived experience of mental health conditions and ensures that my research questions are clinically meaningful. However, my calling lies in contributing to our scientific understanding of these conditions rather than providing direct treatment.

I have tremendous respect for clinical psychologists and the vital work they do. My path simply led me toward research, where I hope to contribute to better understanding and ultimately better treatments for personality pathology. -->
