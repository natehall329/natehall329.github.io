This is a question I get asked frequently, so I thought I'd address it here. While I completed substantial clinical training during my graduate program, including coursework in assessment, psychotherapy, and psychopathology, I ultimately decided not to pursue clinical internship or licensure as a clinical psychologist.

My decision was driven by my passion for research and discovery rather than direct clinical practice. I found myself most energized by questions about the underlying mechanisms of personality pathology, the development of new measurement approaches, and the application of computational methods to understand psychological phenomena.

The clinical training I received has been invaluable to my research - it provides me with a deep understanding of the lived experience of mental health conditions and ensures that my research questions are clinically meaningful. However, my calling lies in contributing to our scientific understanding of these conditions rather than providing direct treatment.

I have tremendous respect for clinical psychologists and the vital work they do. My path simply led me toward research, where I hope to contribute to better understanding and ultimately better treatments for personality pathology.
